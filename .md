# How to be a "12th Man" Seahawks Fan


### Steve Rabel Is The Voice Of Reason
- Steve Rabel is a local radio legend, the voice of the Seahawks. A former Seahawks wide receiver was offered a broadcasting analysis position for the Seahawks in 1982 and has been doing it ever since. He is the voice of reason, you will listen to no other radio station on game days as he has the most accurate analysis of the team.  

### Wear Blue On Fridays 
- Every Friday during the season, the Friday before Sunday's game, you must wear blue or any Seahawk attire all day. This shows your commitment and support for the team as they face the coming opponent.

### Game Day Tailgate
- The main tailgate where the real 12's are, is located on Utah Street, right next to the Starbucks headquarters. New 12's will show up Sunday morning looking for a place to set up their tailgate. Real 12's know you need to show up **Friday** and secure your spot. Some 12's leave a camper/trailer over the weekend to ensure their spot. 

### Stand On Defense, Sit Down On Offense 
- When the defense is on the field, stand up and be loud! We must support our men and help them get on and off the field as fast as possible. When we are on offense, sit down and shut up! Let our boys work in peace while we watch them march down the field to score a touchdown. 
- 
### Always cheer your loudest
- If you still have a voice at the end of the game, you didn't try hard enough! We are a part of the game, 12's have caused seismic **EARTHQUAKES** with our celebrations.  Our home stadium holds the NFL record for most away team false starts, this is because of us! The other team can't communicate when we fill the air with cheering. Our cheering is what defines us,  if you aren't adding to the noise, you aren't a real 12th man.
