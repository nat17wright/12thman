### 12th Man

## Stand on defense, sit down on offense 
- When the defense is on the field, stand up and be loud! We must support our men and help them get on and off the field as fast as possible. When we are on offense, sit down and shut up! Let our boys work in peace while we watch them march down the field to score a touchdown.

## Always cheer your loudest
