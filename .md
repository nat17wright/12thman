# How to be a "12th Man" Seahawks Fan

### Steve Rabel Is The Voice Of Reason
- Steve Rabel is a local radio ledgend, the voice of the Seahawks. A former wide recier himself for the Seahawks, was offered a boardcasting analysis postion for the Seahawsk, and has been doing it ever since. He is the voice of reason, you will listen to no other radio station on game-days as he has the most accuarate analysis of the team.  

### Wear Blue On Friday's 
- Every Friday during season, the Friday before Sunday's game, you must wear blue or any Seahawk attire all day. This shows your commitment and support for the team as they face the comming oppnent.

### Game Day Tailgate
- The main tailgate where the real 12's are, is located on Utah Street, right next to the Starbucks headquarts. New 12's will show up Sunday moring looking for a place to set up their tailgate. Real 12's know you need to show up **Friday** and secure your spot. Some 12's leave a camper/trailor over the weekend to ensure their spot. 

### Stand On Defense, Sit Down On Offense 
- When the defense is on the field, stand up and be loud! We must support our men and help them get on and off the field as fast as possible. When we are on offense, sit down and shut up! Let our boys work in peace while we watch them march down the field to score a touchdown. 
- 
### Always cheer your loudest
- If you still have a voice at the end of the game, you didn't try hard enough! We are apart of the game, us 12's have cause actual **EARTHQUAKES** and hold the record for most opponents false starts. This means our cheers are effective and if you arn't adding to the nosie, you aren't a 12th man.
