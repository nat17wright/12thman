# **The Coffee Lover's Manifesto**

*Many, many people claim the title of coffee lover. But have they really earned it? Do they truly belong to the community of coffee enthusiasts? As an expert in my field before it was cool, I shall lay down before you the ten essential qualities of any true coffee addict.*

**I | Real coffee appreciators drink their cup of joe black.**

   - Face it. If you never enjoy your java without three pumps of caramel, one pump of vanilla, and whip on top, you don’t really like coffee. Coffee fans enjoy the purest, most basic form of coffee – plain.

**II | Coffee fanatics know that the French press is superior to other forms of brewing coffee.**

   - The French press is the coffee equivalent to brewing tea with loose leaf and a strainer – it just tastes better. When the paper filter comes out of the equation, more oils are allowed into the final product, which causes more flavor to remain after the brewing process.

**III | The strong grind their own beans.**

   - Freshly ground coffee beans retain the natural oils produced during the roasting process, which are the main carriers of flavor in coffee! Additionally, whole coffee beans stay fresh and flavorful longer than ground beans.

**IV | Coffee zealots know that Starbucks specializes in Torani flavored syrups, not coffee.**

  - A toasted white chocolate mocha is not coffee, but a dessert with some coffee in it.*

**V | The enlightened few keep up on coffee news.**

  - Coffee devotees keep up to date on coffee practices. There’s always new tips for the perfect water recipe, steeping time, ground textures, and more.

**VI | Death before decaf.**

  - While decaf is a valid choice for folks who want to enjoy coffee without the buzz, chemical decaffeination processes can cause contamination and poor flavor. Look for Swiss Water or liquid carbon dioxide decaffeination processes if you opt for a decaf brew.

**VII | True coffee people homebrew their cold brew.**

  - Cold brew may seem like a café novelty, but it’s easy to make at home for a low cost! All that’s needed is fresh coffee grounds, some filtered water, and time for it to brew.

**VIII | All java admirers know that the brew tastes better out of their special mug.**

  - Some mugs are just better.

**IX | Coffee lovers are financially frugal.**

  - Many a good brew can be steeped from a $10-$15 bag of whole coffee beans, which will get you maybe two $7 frappuccinos from the local Starbucks. Don’t waste your money on a logo. Invest in a good thermos and bring your own coffee to work.

**X | Every cup is brewed with love – coffee is not just caffeine.**
